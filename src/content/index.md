# Metalsmith Static CMS Starter

![](/assets/images/anvil-with-hammer.jpg)

This simple site template is intended to help you getting started with building a static site with Metalsmith. The site includes a couple of sample pages and a blog. The site content can be edited with Static CMS and is ready to be deployed at Netlify.

The rest is left to your imagination.

See the [project page on Github](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms-metalsmith-netlify-template).

Or you can click the button to deploy a copy to Netlify.
